  <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>
    <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties.</p>
    <p> <em>My father recommends:</em> <br>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. <br>Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. <br>In the winter, try serving it warm."</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>18oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
      <li>1 t. capers</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. <br>Blend until as smooth as possi-ble.</li>
      <li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, <br>but still retain some
        texture.</li>
      <li>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</li>
    </ol>
